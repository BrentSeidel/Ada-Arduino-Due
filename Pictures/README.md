# Here are some pictures of what I am using for development on the Arduino Due.

![Original Setup](https://github.com/BrentSeidel/Ada-Arduino-Due/blob/master/Pictures/Breadboard.jpg)
This is the original rat's nest of wiring on a breadboard.  It got to be a little
unwieldily so I 3D printed some panels and racks.

![Front View](https://github.com/BrentSeidel/Ada-Arduino-Due/blob/master/Pictures/Front1.jpg)
The front view of the rack.  This shows with all 16 switches and LEDs installed.

![Top View](https://github.com/BrentSeidel/Ada-Arduino-Due/blob/master/Pictures/Top1.jpg)
The top view of the rack.  This shows the Arduino Due with one small board containing
the resistors for the LEDs, two boards with MCP23017 port extenders installed, and one
board where another MCP23017 can be installed.  This shot is with only one of the front
panels installed.

![Back View](https://github.com/BrentSeidel/Ada-Arduino-Due/blob/master/Pictures/Back1.jpg)
This shows some of the wiring for the front panels.  I'm in the process of installing
connectors to make it easier to remove and replace the panels.
