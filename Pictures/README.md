# Here are some pictures of what I am using for development on the Arduino Due.

![Original Setup](https://github.com/BrentSeidel/Ada-Arduino-Due/blob/master/Pictures/DSC_8733.JPG)
This is the original rat's nest of wiring on a breadboard.  It got to be a little
unwieldly so I 3D printed some panels and racks.

The front view of the rack.  I have another panel with another 8 switches
and LEDs that I plan to install later, but I wanted to get this one working first.

The top view of the rack.  This shows the Arduino Due with one small board containing
the resistors for the LEDs, two boards with MCP23017 port extenders installed, and one
board where another MCP23017 can be installed.
