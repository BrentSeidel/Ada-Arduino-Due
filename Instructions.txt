To setup the environment to do the build:


To build the runtimes, use:
$ gprbuild -P build/BSPs/ravenscar_sfp_sam3x8e.gpr
$ gprbuild -P build/BSPs/zfp_sam3x8e.gpr

To install, use:
$ gprinstall -f -p -P build/BSPs/ravenscar_sfp_sam3x8e.gpr --prefix=./runtimes
$ gprinstall -f -p -P build/BSPs/zfp_sam3x8e.gpr --prefix=./runtimes


After Ada code is compiled use the following commands to prepare and load the binary:

Convert the Ada binary into a binary that can be loaded onto the board:

$ /opt/local/arm-elf/bin/objcopy -O binary main main.bin

To find the usb device on a Mac, do

$ ls -l /dev/cu.usbmodem*

There will be a number following the "usbmodem" that changes from time to time.
If you have only one Arduino plugged in and no other USB serial ports, there
should only be one entry.  If there are more than one, it will take a little
more research.  One possibility would be to fire up the Arduino IDE and look at
the ports.

Press the erase button on the board to erase the flash memory.  The press the reset
button and enter the following command to load the binary onto the board:

$ ./bossac -p cu.usbmodem145150 -U false -e -w -v -b main.bin -R

Once the software is installed, I use picocom to communicate with it.

$ picocom -b 115200 /dev/cu.usbmodem*

Notes:
1. objcopy can be installed from MacPorts in the arm-elf-binutils.
2. bossac can be obtained from the Arduino IDE installation.
