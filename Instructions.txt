To setup the environment to do the build:


To build the runtimes, use:
$ gprbuild -P build/BSPs/ravenscar_sfp_sam3x8e.gpr
$ gprbuild -P build/BSPs/zfp_sam3x8e.gpr

To install, use:
$ gprinstall -f -p -P build/BSPs/ravenscar_sfp_sam3x8e.gpr --prefix=./runtimes
$ gprinstall -f -p -P build/BSPs/zfp_sam3x8e.gpr --prefix=./runtimes


After Ada code is compiled use the following commands to prepare and load the binary:

Convert the Ada binary into a binary that can be loaded onto the board:

$ /opt/local/arm-elf/bin/objcopy -O binary main main.bin

Press the erase button on the board to erase the flash memory.  The press the reset
button and enter the following command to load the binary onto the board:

$ ./bossac -p cu.usbmodem145150 -U false -e -w -v -b main.bin -R

Notes:
1. objcopy can be installed from MacPorts in the arm-elf-binutils.
2. bossac can be obtained from the Arduino IDE installation.
