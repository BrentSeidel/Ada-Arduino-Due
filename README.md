# Ada-Arduino-Due
I now have Ada running on my Arduino Due.  This comes without all the infrastructure that
the Arduino development environment provides.  So some research is in order.

This should be considered a working repository.  As functions get developed, they will
probably migrate to either my BBS-BBB-Ada repository or to the AdaCore Ada_Drivers_library
repository.

## Current Status
Right now I can flash the on-board LED.  I also have serial output working on all four
Arduino Due serial ports in both polled and interrupt driven modes.
