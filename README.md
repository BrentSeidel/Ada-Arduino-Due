# Ada-Arduino-Due
I now have Ada running on my Arduino Due.  This comes without all the infrastructure that
the Arduino development environment provides.  So some research is in order.

This should be considered a working repository.  As functions get developed, they will
probably migrate to either my BBS-BBB-Ada repository or to the AdaCore Ada_Drivers_library
repository.

## Current Status

### General Purpose I/O
Pins can be configured as digital ouptuts or to support alternate (UART)
functions.  Digital input should work, but hasn't yet been tested.  Since the
on-board LED is connected to one of the GPIO pins, it can be flashed.

### Serial ports
The serial driver supports all four available serial ports on the Arduino Due.
Transmit and Receive is supported by both polled and interrupt driven drivers.
The interrupt driven driver also supports RS-485 mode, character echo, and
backspace and delete keys.  This should provide the basics for both console I/O
as well as serial communication with other devices.
